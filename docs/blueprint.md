## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted blue (#6B8E9D) to represent water and the environment.
- Background color: Very light gray (#E0E0E0), an almost-white shade intended as the background for a photograph.
- Accent color: Light, desaturated green (#98B4A6) for links and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet accessible look.
- The background will simulate a desktop. The four main buttons are semi-transparent, creating depth and allowing some of the background image to show through.
